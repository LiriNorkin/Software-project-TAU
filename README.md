# Software-project-TAU
The final project in a software project course I took at TAU. Compares two algorithms: Kmeans & Normalized Spectral Clustering

Run main.py with args: 
k - number of wanted clusters
n - amounts of points (points are randomly in 2 or 3 dimensionals)
rand/no-rand - if rand so the k,n will be generate randomly. else - k,n will be given values.

The program will generate the data and process it, 
the output will be 3 files:
data.txt - all the generate data
clusters.txt - the result clusters from both kmeans &  normalized spectral clustering.
clusters.pdf - graphs of the results of both algorithems and info about the diffreneces.
